title: "Western Covered Wagon Cowboy Horse Whiskey Shot glasses Bar Accessory",
description: "Cowboy whiskey and shot glass covered wagon and horse. Cowboys head comes off with a cork for whiskey storage. Metal holder that has six shot glasses. Made with brown ceramic and hand painted. I am not sure of the age, I could not find another one like it anywhere. I am guessing probably 1950&#39;s. The bottom has a sticker that says Japan. Ten inches long and seven inches high. In great vintage shape with very little wear and only a couple very slight and hard to detect tiny small chips.

The reverse side shares an article and a Miracle Whip recipe. Small tears in corners and wrinkling on the right edge. Many of these vintage ads have browning around the edges. Some have light wear on the edges which would be covered by a frame or matting. I&#39;ve taken close ups of the edges to give an idea of what they look like. Check here for more vintage magazine ads: https://www.etsy.com/shop/BigMamasBasement?section_id=14568812&ref=shopsection_leftnav_7 Please convo me if you see other magazine ads you&#39;d like to buy together (no limit!) No extra charge for additional single page magazine ads sent in the same package. I generally ship in an envelope between 2 pieces of cardboard.

If you need your book more quickly let me know before your purchase. I will get back to you within a day with shipping quotes for parcel post and priority mail (Big Mama never sleeps). Items that do not qualify for media mail are shipped Standard Post/First Class unless it&#39;s less expensive to use the flat rate priority mail boxes/envelopes. Once again, if you would like to upgrade just get in touch with me before you purchase. I&#39;ll do all I can to make it work. Smaller items (1 pound or less) have the correct shipping cost. For heavier items, my shipping charge is an estimate based on what the cost would be to ship across country. Shipping to you could be less and anything over $1 in excess postage will be refunded to you. If you&#39;d like a quote based on your location let me know and I can do that before you purchase! Vintage dress patterns are mailed in padded envelopes. The shipping on vintage patterns to U.S. addresses is $2.90. Purchase one other vintage pattern at the same time and it will be added to the envelope with no additional shipping charge! International Shipping: If you live outside the US and are interested in one or more of my items please contact me for shipping costs. I&#39;d rather give you an exact cost than include a high shipping price that may be much more than it should for your country. Most of my items include the shipping cost to Canada. I add tracking to packages but if you&#39;d like insurance please let me know in advance and I&#39;ll add that to your total cost. ",

There are no postage refunds and it will be your responsibility to ship the item back to BigMamasBasement in the same condition received before any refund can be issued.",

Recently, we decided to make the leap from selling items made by others to selling items that we make. We have been goofing around making all sorts of arts, crafts, scrapbooks, and clothing for many years and decided to combine my hobby with my online business experience. Tyler has an Accounting degree from Tennessee Technological University, and I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in Marketing and an MBA in Accounting from TTU as well. Upon graduating, we tried &quot;real, grown-up jobs&quot; - Tyler as a general manager at a greenhouse manufacturing company, and I as a staff accountant for a nationwide manufacturing company. We spent a couple of years working for &quot;the man&quot;...at a desk eight hours a day...fifty weeks a year. We finally decided to follow our dream of becoming entrepreneurs, pursue our passion, and determine our own future with hands on approach. We chose the path less traveled by, and that has made all the difference. Please don&#39;t hesitate to ask if you have any questions or would like a custom item.

Xo, Cyra and Andrea : : : : : : : : : : : : : : FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS : : : : : : : : : : : : : : WHAT TYPE OF BOTTLE SHOULD I USE WITH MY CUSTOM LABELS? When selecting your a bottles for your custom labels, the shape is important! We prefer smooth bottles with a body that&#39;s the same width from top to bottom, and have tall shoulders. You want to avoid wine and champagne bottles have funny shapes or odd textures. To give you a better idea, most Cab and Sauvignon Blanc bottles will work, as well as champagne bottles similar to the shape of Veuve or Moet Chandon. You also want the body to be taller than your custom labels. If the body is too short, you might find the labels will bubble at the top or bottom once applied. : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : HOW DO I REMOVE THE EXISTING WINE LABELS FROM MY BOTTLES?

policy_payment: "We require payment in full before we get started on your order. Due to our volume of sales, especially during peak wedding season, we do not offer custom proofs prior to purchase. We are happy to send you a sample of a previous design however, no custom work will be done without payment. ",
policy_shipping: "SHIPPING TIMEFRAME: * Standard Turnaround - 3-4 Business Days (we are closed weekends and holidays) * Rush Turnaround - 1 Business Day * TO PREVENT DELAYS in the process, be sure to include all information for customization at the time of purchase. Please note, if we run in to any issues with your custom color choices or special requests, there may be a slight delay with your order so chat with you regarding the changes. A NOTE ABOUT SHIPPING - As much as we would love to deliver your labels to you in person, we have to rely on a 3rd party service to get our labels from point A to point B. For the most part, mail is delivered in time as promised, however there are occasions where USPS will quote a delivery date and will fail to deliver by that time. Things such as bad weather, natural disasters, and delayed USPS handling can and do happen from time to time and are unfortunately out of our control. We will do everything in our power to get you your labels as soon as possible, however for the above reasons, Label with Love will not guarantee any shipping times and is not responsible for the late arrival if your labels were shipped on time. { STANDARD SHIPPING } $3.95 US, $7.99 Canada, $10.99 International Shipping rates quoted in our listings are for USPS First Class Ground. The USPS quotes shipping time at 3-6 business days within the US, 7-10 business days to Canada, and 2-4 weeks for international delivery. Please note, these are note guaranteed ship times and are meant as a guideline only. CUSTOMS - International Customers - USPS does not guarantee these shipping times and from time-to-time there are significant delays in Customs. *** IMPORT TAX OR CUSTOMS DUTIES - INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS: From time to time, when a package is shipped internationally, it may be subject to import taxes, customs duties, and/or fees imposed by the destination country. Sellers on Etsy are unable to predict which of these fees, if any, will be applied, and Etsy does not expect sellers to calculate or collect these fees or taxes. For that reason, Etsy does not hold sellers responsible for unexpected customs fees or taxes. EXPEDITED SHIPPING OPTIONS { PRIORITY MAIL - US ONLY } additional cost $4.50 Please note, this is an UPGRADE TO SHIPPING ONLY. Priority MAIL usually takes 2-3 business days once your order is shipped, however it is not 100% guaranteed by the post office. We can guarantee to ship within 3-4 Business days of your order, however we cannot 100% guarantee that your package will reach you within 2-3 business days once shipped. { EXPRESS PRIORITY - US ONLY } Additional cost $15.00 Express Priority is the ONLY guaranteed way to get your package in 2 business days after your package is shipped. Please note, this is an UPGRADE TO SHIPPING ONLY. This shipping method is guaranteed by the USPS or your shipping is refunded in full. Proofs will still have a 2 business day turnaround. Please contact us if you would like to update to Rush Turnaround with Express Shipping. { RUSH ORDER } *May be disabled due to work load* (additional cost $17.50) The rush option is available for our US customers only. The upgrade to a RUSH order includes a 1 business day turnaround for proofs and packaging. Rush orders are shipped the first business day following your purchase via USPS Priority 2-3 Day. Please contact us is you would like to upgrade to a faster shipping option. Rush orders placed over the weekend will receive proofs Monday for shipping Tuesday. { RUSH EXPRESS } *May be disabled due to work load* (additional cost $27.50) The Rush Express option is available for our US customers only.

Rush Express orders placed over the weekend will receive proofs Monday for shipping Tuesday. INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING UPGRADES Please contact us if you would like us to quote pricing for expedited shipping options ",
policy_refunds: "Because all of our labels are made to order, we do not offer full refunds once the design process has begun.

If you decide to cancel your order after the the design process in underway, we are happy to offer you a partial refund of your order. { DAMAGED LABELS } If for any reason your labels are damaged in transit from us to you, we are happy to send you a new set. We trust the USPS for the most part, but we understand that things happen. Label with Love is not responsible if your label rips or wrinkles during the application or removal process, or if the adhesive is compromised once removed from it&#39;s backing. While our labels are very durable, we do recommend that you take great care when placing them on your bottle.

sale_message: "Thank you SO much for your business! YOU are awesome! We love our customers and will make every effort to get your items to you as quickly as possible! Please bear with us during our busy seasons, we are working as fast as we can! ☆ Visit our new website for additional fun products! www.thebeardedbee.us ☆ You can join our email list to receive discounts & coupon codes via: http://tinyurl.com/l8m5ysy DOMESTIC (U.S.) SHIPPING : --------------------------------------- ♥ Current turn around is 2-5 Business Days. You will receive an email with tracking when your order dispatches. Packages ordered with standard shipping usually arrive within 2-5 business days of shipment via USPS. For items under 16 oz USPS first class is the standard delivery method and for items over 1 lb USPS Priority Mail is the standard service. ♥ If you are unable to receive USPS packages, contact us and we can set up another service for you. ♥ Need it in a Hurry? We do our best to offer the least expensive and most effective rates possible on standard shipping, but we know some items are needed quickly. We offer expedited shipping via USPS Express Mail (1-2 business days). All upgraded shipping orders will be rushed out as quickly as possible to ensure the quickest delivery. Since there is a cutoff time for express shipments, please allow up to 1 day for the item to be shipped out. If you have any questions or need an item by a specific date, contact us and we&#39;ll be happy to help arrange the best shipping method for your needs. ♥ USPS does not guarantee shipping times unless USPS Express Mail is used (1-2 business days). ♥ Signature Confirmation can be added separately to USPS orders and is recommended for those in apartments and urban areas. INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING: ------------------------------------- ♥ We&#39;re based in the US & love shipping to our international friends!! We are now able to offer the best rates possible. International shipping normally takes 2-5 weeks with the standard economy rate service. Processing time is 1-5 business days prior to shipment. ♥ We ship to all countries; however, buyers in Brazil, Vietnam, Philippines, or anywhere in Africa must contact us beforehand to arrange shipping for their items. These countries tend to have regular issues receiving packages and will be required to use a different shipping service with mandatory tracking and insurance. ♥ The standard international shipping service has limited tracking to some destinations. Please consider upgrading your shipping option if door-to-door tracking and speed of delivery are important. You can contact us to set up rush delivery as the cost will vary by item an country. ♥ Please be aware that you may be charged certain international CUSTOMS FEES/TAXES according to your country&#39;s rules and regulations, which are not in our control and are not included in the shipping price. You are responsible for paying them to your postal courier. If you refuse the package & it is returned to us, your shipping will not be refunded. IF YOU HAVE ALLERGIES: ----------------------------------- ♥ While some of our items are made of synthetic materials, they can still come in to contact with other products that contain natural or animal fibers (i.e. cotton, wool, angora, etc.) while in storage. If you have ANY allergies, be sure to notify us beforehand and also clean your garment(s) upon receiving them for this reason. LOST PARCELS: ---------------------- ♥ We ship to the address that you provide upon checkout and do not take any liability in the case of lost or returned parcels. Please contact us, if you believe your package is being returned to sender because of an incorrect address, and we will work with you to make sure it arrives safely. New postage will need to be purchased by the buyer to re-ship misaddressed items. PLEASE Double check your shipping address, especially Paypal customers. ♥ If your package tracking status is marked &#39;delivered&#39; and you do not receive your package, you will need to check with your household members, neighbors, post office, and postman. Unless you added signature confirmation, or upgraded to Express Mail, we cannot be responsible for any packages stolen from your home or complex. Thank you for your cooperation & have a wonderful day! All the best, Sara + Bryan ",

policy_payment: "We strongly prefer immediate payment via PayPal or Direct Checkout. Orders will be shipped within 1-5 business days of payment being processed unless otherwise noted. If you use an e-check, shipping may be delayed up to 10 business days (due to PayPal transaction times). ",
policy_shipping: "Shipping time varies by destination & post office. Orders within the US typically arrive within 1-7 business days of being shipped out (ship time is different than processing time). Processing time depends on the time of year but is typically no more than 5 business days. ****PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR SHIPPING INFO IS CORRECT!!!**** If a package is returned to us due to an incorrectly provided shipping address, the buyer will be responsible for covering the cost of re-shipping the item. All orders are shipped to the shipping address on your Etsy invoice. Please ensure that your address is current on your Etsy account - orders delivered to incorrect addresses are not retrievable by us once shipped and are non-refundable. INTERNATIONAL: All international orders are shipped via USPS, or one of their third parties unless otherwise requested. We are unable to accurately track some international orders that are shipped via any method other than Fedex. We only have information about the package until it leaves the US, as not all countries will scan the tracking info. Depending on the destination, international packages typically take anywhere from 1-5 weeks to arrive. Unfortunately, we cannot make any ship time guarantees for international deliveries unless you upgrade your shipping to Fedex 1-3 day guaranteed shipping. Orders to Italy, Vietnam, Singapore, Tasmania, Brazil, & remote destinations tend to take longer than average to process through customs. We no longer offer shipping to African countries. **We have done our very best to offer the most economical and cost effective rates possible with standard international shipping, but again please keep in mind this is the least time sensitive. We have no way of guaranteed tracking on orders with this service. If you are interested in receiving your item quickly, or require accurate tracking, please upgrade your shipping, or contact us beforehand!** Please note that our shipping charge only covers the cost to ship and insure your items. It does not cover any additional brokerage fees and/or import taxes you may incur from your country&#39;s customs office. INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMS: (Especially EU buyers): Please take into account that items may be held for additional import/VAT fees in your country of residence. These fees are separate from your purchase with us, and it is your responsibility to pay them. LOST MAIL: To prevent mis-delivery or theft, we encourage that buyers add signature confirmation to their order when checking out (especially if you live in an apartment complex or urban area). If a package is lost in the mail, please contact us and we can help you file a claim with the shipping carrier. If the package is not received & the tracking status is marked &quot;delivered&quot; by the carrier, you will need to check with your neighbors, household members, and local post office. Due to escalated cases of theft & fraud, we cannot reimburse, refund, or send you a new item if the package tracking says that it was successfully delivered to your home. ",
policy_refunds: "All items, with the exception of earrings, can be returned for a refund. To initiate a return, please contact us via Etsy message. Please include a note somewhere within the package with your full name & order number so that we can process the refund quickly. Refunds are for the item cost only, and do not include shipping costs. All returns/exchanges must be made within 14 days of product sale date. Orders may be cancelled before they have been post-marked. Cancelled orders will receive a full refund, minus any small fees incurred via the method of checkout. ",
policy_additional: "All vintage items are previously owned. Due to the nature of vintage clothes, we suggest washing your newly purchased item(s) before wearing. If your item has a tag with wash/care instructions, we highly advise you follow them (some items may be dry clean only, etc.) We strive to ensure all of our vintage items are free from stains, rips, tears, pulls, etc. If for some reason there is any irreparable damage to an item, it will be clearly communicated in the item&#39;s description and photo(s). If you are allergic to any specific materials, PLEASE make note of it in the comments box at checkout. We will not be held responsible if you do not disclose this information at the time of purchase.

We do refund the difference if the estimated shipping costs were higher than the actual shipping cost. Please check your Etsy convos until the item is shipped just in case we have a question or email you a proof. Please note that buyers are responsible for any and all duties and customs charges that may be incurred. Please allow up to 40 days for International orders due to packages being held at customs. If for any reason the address you entered on the invoice was incorrect and the package is returned to us we will contact you as soon as we can. A private listing will be set up for you to purchase the postage a second time with a new shipping address.",

In the event that we make an error, we will either replace the item or offer a full refund. Items that have not been personalized may be returned for a refund less shipping costs within 10 days. Before you leave negative feedback we would appreciate the opportunity to fix, replace or refund a product if you are not satisfied. It is very important to us that you are happy with your purchase.",
policy_additional: "All of our engraved, fused and art glass is made in the USA. We do our best choosing the highest quality glass. However, small bubbles and swirls in the glass are normal, since glass is made with organic materials, and will not affect the glassware. Our candleholder/vases are hand blown glass. There is usually a small bubble on the rim where the glass is separated from the glass blowing tube. All pieces are created by hand, so no two items are identical. If an item is listed with more than one item for sale, please allow for slight variances from what is shown in the photo. We can direct ship the item and include a note if this is a gift. Please include what you would like written on the note in the comments box during checkout. We will only include an invoice upon request. Invoices can always be printed from your Etsy account at any time. We do not engrave profanity, vulgar, defamatory or derogatory designs. We use ceramic molds to make our violet pots, but when clay dries it doesn&#39;t always dry evenly which can cause small gaps between the insert and the base. We strive for perfection, yet that&#39;s what makes handmade items unique - they aren&#39;t perfect! ",

policy_shipping: "Shipping is completed within 1 to 3 business days from date of purchase. I am happy to combine shipping on multiple purchases if I can safely do so without risking breakage. Any shipping overages that are paid will be promptly refunded when shipped. How are Shipping costs determined? My shop is located in Indiana. The USPS bases the shipping fee on the distance being shipped (based on postal zones) and the weight and dimensions of the package. The shipping fees shown are based on shipping from Indiana to the far west coast USA. Your actual shipping fee may actually be less depending upon your location or the destination of your purchase. Any overages paid will be promptly refunded when shipped, we do not make a profit on shipping fees. What if your purchase is a gift? If you are purchasing a treasure for a gift and would like to have it shipped directly to the recipient, no worries about receipts or invoices. I never put a paper copy in with my packaging. You will have a copy on your computer. Your gift recipient (if you choose to have it shipped directly to them) will not see any of the paperwork. For International Shipping - I ship internationally and strive for the most economical method of delivery. Please convo me with your Ship To address and I will give you the shipping charge amount prior to your purchase. Seller is not responsible for any VAT or Customs charges that may be imposed.",
policy_refunds: "We accept returns for any reason within 14 days of receipt. If you simply change your mind, return your purchase in the same condition received and in the original packaging and your purchase price of the item will be refunded promptly when I receive the item back. The shipping expenses incurred are the buyer&#39;s responsibility. If you feel the item pictures or description grossly misrepresents the item, seller will assume responsibility for all shipping, including return shipping. I provide detailed pictures and a thorough description, purchase with confidence.",
policy_additional: "Just a mention that items from my shop are vintage items, not new items. All have been previously owned and as with most vintage items, they are gently used and may show signs of use and wear. I try my best to give an accurate description. I will note in the item description any sign of wear that would affect the functionality or overall appeal of the item. If you are looking for Coco&#39;s Vintage Closet, my other Etsy shop, please note that I have moved all of Coco&#39;s inventory on Etsy to The Vintage Porch shop.

policy_payment: "Payment due upon purchase. Taxes are due for purchases from those residing in California. We accept both PAYPAL and DIRECT CHECK OUT via Etsy. Paypal allows for payment via Paypal account, credit/debit card or via echeck (echeck takes about a week to clear). If paying by e-check product will not be made or shipped until e-check has cleared. Direct check-out via Etsy allows for credit/debit cards directly without any Paypal involvement. ",
policy_shipping: "DOMESTIC SHIPPING: We ship USPS Priority and it includes online tracking, I will send you the tracking number once shipped. If you want to upgrade your domestic order to Express mail, PLEASE see listing in my shop marked &quot;Express Shipping&quot; or contact us BEFORE placing your order. Large orders are shipped UPS and require a signature when delivered. INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING: Shipping to all other countries will be shipped USPS First Class with no tracking number available. Once items leave the US they are no longer the shop&#39;s responsibility. Customs in your country may charge a fee and will be buyer’s responsibility and will not be paid by Southern Girl Apparel. Please check on your country&#39;s customs rates before purchase. PLEASE NOTE that for international shipments, there may be unexpected delays if your package is held at customs. We have no control over shipments after they leave our hands. Buyers are responsible for any import duties imposed by their country of residence. All orders shipped internationally through Etsy include the full purchase price on the customs form. STOLEN AFTER DELIVERY or UNDELIVERABLE DUE TO SHIPPING ADDRESS PROVIDED ON ETSY: Refunds or replacements will *not* be issued for merchandise that has been &quot;delivered&quot; to your requested address, according to the USPS tracking number, but you claim you never received it. I am not responsible for your stolen mail, and will not provide a replacement at my expense or a refund for your missing goods. You can request a signature confirmation at delivery for an additional $2.20 USD. Also, partial refunds (minus original shipping) are issued when an order is returned to me because a delivery attempt was made and a notice was left, but the buyer did not pick up the package or arrange a re-delivery for whatever reason, or an incorrect address was provided by the buyer on Etsy. If you choose to have me re-ship the product back to you, it will be AT YOUR EXPENSE -- no exceptions. *PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE check your ADDRESS in ETSY prior to purchasing. I ship your purchase to your Etsy address. Sometimes, Etsy will try to add a &quot;Street&quot;, &quot;Terr&quot; or &quot;Drive&quot; to your address. I DO NOT alter your shipping address. Please understand there may be a shipping delay if you do not include the full address as USPS considers this an &quot;Unconfirmed&quot; shipping address. If you realize your address is incorrect after purchase, please convo me ASAP to avoid a delay in shipping and/or not receiving your purchase* ORDERS LOST IN TRANSIT: In the event that a US order is *lost in transit* by the US Postal Service and has not arrived in 45 days, as verified by the tracking information, you will be offered a refund minus the original shipping charges. I am not responsible for orders listed as &#39;delivered&#39; that are stolen after delivery (see details above). If your international order has not arrived in 45 days, it is likely lost or stolen. I am not responsible for lost or stolen international orders where I can guarantee the box was shipped by providing you with a shipping receipt on paper. Unfortunately, tracking numbers are only available for international orders where expensive priority international mail is used, which I do not offer, as it is always more expensive than the cost of my goods. ",
policy_refunds: "We do want you to be perfectly happy with your purchase but if for some reason you are not I do allow a one time exchange on most items, just send it back to me, be sure to include a note of what size you want. And we will accept returns within 7 days. However, the customer will be responsible for shipping costs; we will ONLY refund the purchase price. If a refund is requested on a listing with free shipping, the shipping costs will be subtracted before refund is submitted. ALL ITEMS RETURNED MUST BE IN NEW, UNUSED AND UNLAUNDERED CONDITION. WE ONLY RETURN ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN PURCHASED DIRECTLY FROM ETSY/SOUTHERNGIRLAPPAREL.COM. All ITEMS MUST HAVE THEIR ORIGINAL TAGS ATTACHED. If you receive an item that is damaged send a note and a photo and we&#39;ll start working with you right away to exchange or refund your purchase. I&#39;m sorry I do not accept returns on holiday items, 4th of July, Christmas, Easter, Halloween, Thanksgiving, etc... I put the measurements and do my best to describe the item in the &quot;Item Details&quot; area so be sure to check them before ordering.",
policy_additional: "We endeavor to represent our items as accurately as we can online, but please bear in mind that all computer monitors are calibrated differently and some colors may appear differently on your screen than in real life. *If you have ANY questions, please do not hesitate to send me a convo via Etsy.

Sometimes a package is marked as delivered but does not make it into the buyer&#39;s possession. When the US postal service tells us they have delivered the package to a correctly addressed location, we must assume theft. Therefore, we do not issue refunds or replacements on orders identified by USPS as delivered. INTERNATIONAL SHIPMENTS: Items shipped via First Class International USPS mail cannot be tracked and will not be insured if your item is lost in the mail. Under these conditions we cannot offer refund or replacement. Estimated delivery time averages 15 business days from date shipped. When customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond our original delivery estimates. International customers are responsible for all import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country. All international orders will have full value declared on customs forms, and will be marked as &quot;merchandise&quot;. If you are ordering an item as a gift for someone else and want to avoid import taxes, we recommend having it shipped to you first, then forwarding it to the recipient as we cannot classify items as &quot;gifts&quot; on customs forms.",

In this rare event, your order will be promptly replaced or refunded. Please double check the spelling of any custom embroidery or embossing as we cannot offer a refund or an exchange of a customized product if you have made a mistake while ordering.",
policy_additional: "Because leather is a natural material, slight variations in color and texture will occur. We do our best to match materials as closely as possible within each order, but we cannot guarantee identical leather between separate orders. All color options will be labelled in each product listing, please check before you select a color as we cannot replace or refund your order if you selected the wrong color. Any changes to your order must be made within 24 hours of placing your order. We cannot provide refunds or exchanges if you provided incorrect personalization instructions.",
